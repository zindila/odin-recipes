            <li>Make Dough: Mix eggs, milk, and salt together until smooth.  Stir in one cup of flour until smooth. Add additional flour, just a small spoonful at a time, until the dough comes together in
                 a ball, but is still slightly sticky.</li> <br>
                 <li>Knead: Dump dough out onto a floured surface. Use well floured hands to knead the dough with your hands, until it’s no longer sticky, 
                    about 3-5 minutes. Allow dough to rest for 10 minutes.</li> <br>
                    <li>Roll Out: With a rolling pin, roll out dough onto a lightly floured counter until it’s 
                        very thin – less than 1/4” thick or paper thin.</li> <br>
                        <li>Cut Noodles: Using a sharp knife or pizza cutting wheel, cut the noodles into long 
                            strips, however narrow or wide you like. I</li><br>
